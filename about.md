# Introduction to Markdown

## Overview
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Why Markdown?
It's widely used for README files, documentation, and simplyfying the process of writing content on the web.

Markdown allows you to write using an **easy-to-read-, easy-to-write plain text format**, which then converts to structurally valid HTML.
